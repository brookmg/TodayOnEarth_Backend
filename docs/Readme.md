Today on earth ( TOE ) is an API for interest based feed aggregation and categorization. It monitors different social media platforms of specific providers in a pre-defined time gap to fetch new posts. 

Features you would find in our API are: 

- Feed update based on your **Interests**
- Choose which provider you want us to follow for you. `We hear Elon Musk is a fun dude` 
- Define the frequency in which you want to be updated.
- Manage your social medias from one dashboard `API in this case`
- Authenticate yourself using any social account you have
